                   TWOTOWERS 5.1 LICENSE AGREEMENT

This is the license agreement for the distribution and use of the
software tool TwoTowers 5.1 (the software) between you (the licensee)
and Marco Bernardo (the licensor).

The software is being made available to the licensee by the licensor
under a site license free of charge, provided that the licensee is
an employee of an educational or non-profit organization (like e.g.
university, school, public research center).

The licensee may network the software on as many computers at the
licensee organization site as the licensee wishes, and may make as many
copies as needed for installation and backup purposes, but the software
may not be used at all off site. The licensee may not use the software
as the basis for a commercial product of any kind without prior
permission of the licensor. The licensee may merge the software
with other programs but may not distribute any program that
contains the software, nor may the licensee modify the software
in order to derive a benefit not granted by this license.

Title to the software, including intellectual properties (copyrights,
trademarks, and patentable material), shall remain with the licensor
at all times. If the licensee makes any copies of the software, the
licensor copyright notices shall be included on the copies. If the
licensee publishes results of use of the software, the licensee will
include the licensor copyright notices on such publications and will
acknowledge the licensor as the source of the software.

The licensor may not be expected to provide any support for the
software. The licensee agrees to report any problem with the software
to the licensor, but the licensor is under no obligation to correct
those problems. Should patches be developed by the licensor, the
licensor agrees to provide the licensee with them free of charge.

The licensee acknowledges and understands that the software and
related documentation are provided "as is" and without warranty of
any kind. The licensor expressly disclaims all warranties, expressed
or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranty of
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, and the warranty
that use of the software will not infringe the intellectual property
rights of a third party. Under no circumstances, including negligence,
shall the licensor be liable for any incidental, special, or
consequential damages that result from the use or inability to use
the software or related documentation, even if the licensor has been
advised of the possibility of such damages.

This is a legal agreement between the licensee and the licensor.
Should any dispute arise under this agreement, such a dispute shall
be settled according to the laws of the Italian Republic. The licensee
agrees to abide by all of the terms as stated herein.
